		<h2 class="chapter_title">INTRODUCTORY.</h2>

		<p>This thesis attempts to trace the growth of the pragmatic doctrine
		of truth through the works of its three most famous advocates in
		America.</p>

		<p>An examination of Peirce’s initial statement of pragmatism is followed
		by a discussion of his objections to the meaning put upon his
		doctrine by his would-be disciples, and his resort, in order to save
		himself from these ‘perversions’, to a renaming of his theory. Some
		evident contradictions in his different principles are pointed out.</p>

		<p>The changing position of William James is then followed through
		magazine articles and books appearing successively during a period
		of about thirty years. One finds here a gradually but continually
		widening divergence from the rationalistic theories, which culminates
		finally in the much-quoted extreme statements of the book ‘Pragmatism’.
		The few subsequently published references to truth seem to consist
		largely of defenses or retractions of the tenets there set forth. As
		has been so often said, William James was too sympathetic toward the
		doctrines of other men to maintain a consistent doctrine of his own.
		His best work, like that of the higher literary type to which he approached,
		was to transcribe and interpret the feelings of other men.
		His genius lay in the clearness with which he could translate these
		ideas and the lucid fashion in which he could cut to the heart of
		ambiguities in them. With the highest and most sincere admiration for
		the spirit of James’ labors in philosophy and psychology, the writer is
		unable to find there permanent contributions to the solution of the
		particular problem which we have before us here, the problem of
		truth. In his splendid protest against all static theories, he seems to
		have accepted pragmatism for what it was not rather than for what it
		was. It was not a cut-and-dried system leaving no room for individuality,
		and that this was one of his strongest reasons for accepting it is
		shown by his asking again and again: “If this (pragmatism) is not
		truth, what is?” He was attempting to find a theory—almost any
		theory, one thinks sometimes—which would serve as an alternative to
		the older doctrines so incompatible with his temperament.</p>

		<p>It is interesting to note that the frequent protests made by Peirce
		against the turn given his ideas by his followers are always directed
		against the work of James and Schiller, and never, so far as I have
		<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>been able to ascertain, against that of Dewey. It therefore seems
		worth while to undertake a direct comparison between the views of
		Peirce and Dewey. This comparison, then, occupies the latter part of
		the thesis, with the result, it may be said at once, that Dewey’s work
		is found to be very closely related to the original formulation of pragmatism
		as made by Peirce.</p>

		<p>The excellent historical sketches of pragmatism which have appeared
		during the last five years<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="See for example..." class="fnmarker">1</a> have been somewhat broader in scope
		than the present treatise, for they have usually described the development
		of all the pragmatic doctrines in the mass while the emphasis here is
		placed on the intensive treatment of a single doctrine, and this doctrine
		is followed, moreover, through a limited number of its expounders.
		Further, almost all such sketches are taken up for the most part in
		showing how pragmatism grew out of the older doctrines or in contrasting
		it with various alternative theories while the thing attempted
		here is, again, a careful comparison of the views of three thinkers
		within the School itself—with of course the writer’s own reaction to
		these views. It has thus seemed best to undertake no (necessarily
		fragmentary) treatment of truth as ‘intuition’ or ‘coherence’ or ‘correspondence’
		or the rest.</p>

		<p>General criticism of the pragmatic theory of truth, as is evident
		to anyone who has followed the controversy, has been principally
		directed against the more ‘radical’ statements of James and Schiller.
		Whether this is merely because these champions of the theory are more
		extreme, or whether they are really more prone to errors in their
		reasoning, we need not determine here. But it is worth pointing out
		that, on the other hand, if Peirce and Dewey were to be taken as the
		truer representatives of pragmatism a large part of the flood of recent
		criticism would be irrelevant. This is by no means to say that the
		work of Peirce and Dewey is above criticism; it is merely to call attention
		to the fact that most of the criticism of pragmatism is directed
		against principles which these two men do not happen to hold. An
		understanding of the doctrine in its more conservative terms, however,
		is certainly on the increase, and we are seldom nowadays burdened with
		refutations of such alleged pragmatism as that anything is true which
		it is pleasant to believe or that any theory of procedure is true which
		happens to turn out well.</p>

		THE PRAGMATIC DOCTRINE AS ORIGINALLY PROPOSED BY PEIRCE.</h2>

		<p>Pragmatism has been described as an attitude of mind, as a method
		of investigation, and as a theory of truth. The attitude is that of
		looking forward to outcomes rather than back to origins. The method
		is the use of actual or possible outcomes of our ideas to determine these
		ideas’ real meaning. The theory of truth defines the truth of our beliefs
		in terms of the outcome of these beliefs.</p>

		<p>Pragmatism as a principle of method, like the Mendelian laws of
		heredity, lay for decades in oblivion. It was brought to light and to
		the world’s notice in 1898 by William James, who by his wonderful
		literary style immediately gave it the widest currency. The doctrine
		was originally proposed in 1878 by C. S. Peirce in a paper for the
		Popular Science Monthly entitled “How To Make Our Ideas Clear.”
		This article was the second of six on the general topic. “Illustrations
		of the Logic of Science.” The other articles of the series were respectively
		called “The Fixation of Belief,” “The Doctrine of Chances,”
		“The Probability of Induction,” “The Order of Nature,” and “Induction,
		Deduction, and Hypothesis.”</p>

		<p>In the famous discussion of How To Make Our Ideas Clear,
		Peirce pointed out that by a <em>clear</em> idea is meant, according to the logicians,
		one which will be recognized wherever it is met with, so that no other
		will be mistaken for it. But since to do this without exception is impossible
		to human beings, and since to have such acquaintance with the
		idea as to have lost all hesitancy in recognizing it <em>in ordinary cases</em>
		amounts only to a subjective feeling of mastery which may be entirely
		mistaken, they supplement the idea of ‘clearness’ with that of ‘distinctness’.
		A distinct idea is defined as one that contains nothing which is
		not clear. By the <em>contents</em> of an idea logicians understand whatever is
		contained in its definition, so that an idea is <em>distinctly</em> apprehended,
		according to them, when we can give a precise definition of it, in abstract
		terms. Here the professional logicians leave the subject, but it is easy
		to show that the doctrine that familiar use and abstract distinctness make
		the perfection of apprehension, “has its only true place in philosophies
		which have long been extinct”, and it is now time to formulate a method
		of attaining “a more perfect clearness of thought such as we see and
		admire in the thinkers of our own time”.</p>

		<p>The action of thought is excited by the irritation of a doubt, and
		ceases when belief is attained; so that the production of belief is the
		sole function of thought. As thought appeases the irritation of a doubt,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>which is the motive for thinking, it relaxes and comes to rest for a
		moment when belief is reached. But belief is a rule for action, and
		its application requires further thought and further doubt, so that at
		the same time that it is a stopping place it is also a new starting place
		for thought. The final upshot of thinking is the exercise of volition.</p>

		<p>“The essence of belief is the establishment of a habit, and different
		beliefs are distinguished by the different modes of action to which they
		give rise. If beliefs do not differ in this respect, if they appease the
		same doubt by producing the same rule of action, then no more differences
		in the manner of consciousness of them can make them different
		beliefs, any more than playing a tune in different keys is playing a
		different tune.”</p>

		<p>Imaginary distinctions are made very frequently, it is true, between
		beliefs which differ only in their mode of expression. Such false distinctions
		do as much harm as the confusion of beliefs really different.
		“One singular deception of this sort, which often occurs, is to mistake
		the sensation produced by our own unclearness of thought for a character
		of the object we are thinking. Instead of perceiving that the
		obscurity is purely subjective, we fancy that we contemplate a quality
		of the object which is essentially mysterious; and if our conception be
		afterwards presented to us in a clear form we do not recognize it as the
		same, owing to the absence of the feeling of unintelligibility…. Another
		such deception is to mistake a mere difference in the grammatical
		construction of two words for a distinction between the ideas they
		express…. From all these sophisms we shall be perfectly safe so long
		as we reflect that the whole function of thought is to produce habits
		of action; and that whatever is connected with a thought, but irrelevant
		to its purpose, is an accretion to it, but no part of it”.</p>

		<p>“To develop a meaning we have, therefore, simply to determine
		what habits it produces, for what a thing means is simply what habits
		it involves. Now the identity of a habit depends on how it might lead
		us to act, not merely under such circumstances as are likely to arise,
		but under such as might possibly occur, no matter how improbable….
		Thus we come down to what is tangible and practical as the root of
		every real distinction of thought, no matter how <em>subtle</em> it may be; and
		there is no distinction so fine as to consist in anything but a possible
		difference in practice”.</p>

		<p>As an example, consider the doctrine of <ins title="transsubstantiation">transubstantiation</ins>. Are
		the elements of the sacrament flesh and blood ‘only in a tropical sense’
		or are they literally just that? Now “we have no conception of wine
		except what may enter into a belief either, (1) that this, that, or the
		other is wine, or (2) that wine possesses certain properties. Such beliefs
		are nothing but self-notifications that we should, upon occasion,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>act in regard to such things as we believe to be wine according to the
		qualities which we believe wine to possess. The occasion of such action
		would be some sensible perception, the motive of it to produce some
		sensible result. Thus our action has exclusive reference to what affects
		our senses, our habit has the same bearing as our action, our belief the
		same as our habit, our conception the same as our belief; and we can
		consequently mean nothing by wine but what has certain effects, direct
		or indirect, upon the senses; and to talk of something as having all
		the sensible characters of wine, yet being in reality blood, is senseless
		jargon…. Our idea of anything <em>is</em> our idea of its sensible effects; and
		if we fancy that we have any other, we deceive ourselves, and mistake
		a mere sensation accompanying the thought for a part of the thought
		itself”.</p>

		<p>“It appears, then, that the rule for attaining … clearness of apprehension
		is as follows: <em>Consider what effects, which might conceivably
		have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to
		have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception
		of the object”.</em> (Italics mine).</p>

		<p>An application of this method to a conception which particularly
		concerns logic occupies the last section of the article,—a use of the
		method to make clear our conception of “reality”. Considering clearness
		in the sense of familiarity, no idea could be clearer than this, for
		everyone uses it with perfect confidence. Clearness in the sense of
		definition is only slightly more difficult,—“we may define the real as
		that whose characters are independent of what anybody may think
		them to be”. But however satisfactory this is as a definition, it does
		not by any means make our idea of reality perfectly clear. “Here,
		then, let us apply our rules. According to them, reality, like every other
		quality, consists in the peculiar sensible effects which things partaking
		of it produce. The only effect which real things have is to cause belief,
		for all the sensations which they excite emerge into consciousness in
		the form of beliefs. The question therefore is, how is true belief (or
		belief in the real) distinguished from false belief (belief in fiction)”<ins title=",">.</ins>
		Briefly this may be answered by saying that the true belief is the one
		which will be arrived at after a complete examination of all the evidence.
		“That opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who
		investigate, is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented
		in this opinion is the real.” (Note: “Fate means merely that which
		is sure to come true, and can nohow be avoided”.) The real thus
		depends indeed upon what is ultimately thought about it, but not upon
		what any particular person thinks about it. This is clearly brought
		out in contrast to non-scientific investigation, where personal equation
		counts for a great deal more. “It is hard to convince a follower of
		<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>the <em>a priori</em> method by adducing facts; but show him that an opinion
		that he is defending is inconsistent with what he has laid down elsewhere,
		and he will be very apt to retract it. These minds do not seem
		to believe that disputation is ever to cease; they seem to think that
		the opinion which is natural for one man is not so for another, and that
		belief will, consequently, never be settled. In contenting themselves with
		fixing their own opinions by a method which would lead another man
		to a different result, they betray their feeble hold upon the conception
		of what truth is. On the other hand, all the followers of science are
		fully persuaded that the processes of investigation, if only pushed far
		enough, will give one certain solution to every question to which they
		can be applied. One man may investigate the velocity of light by studying
		the transits of Venus and the aberration of the stars; another by the
		opposition of Mars and eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; a third by the
		method of Fizian…. They may at first obtain different results, but as
		each perfects his method and his processes, the results will move
		steadily together toward a destined center. So with all scientific research.
		Different minds may set out with the most antagonistic views,
		but the process of investigation carries them by a force outside of themselves
		to one and the same conclusion”. This conclusion, to be sure,
		may be long postponed, and might indeed be preceded by a false belief
		which should be accepted universally. But “the opinion which would
		finally result from investigation does not depend on how anybody may
		actually think…. The reality of that which is real does depend on
		the real fact that the investigation is destined to lead, at last, if continued
		long enough, to a belief in it”.</p>

		<p>It will be seen that this article does not intend to put forward any
		new theory of truth. It is simply an attempt at expounding a new
		theory of clearness. Peirce desires to describe a new way of clearing
		up metaphysical disputes, the method, namely, of finding the meaning
		of each question by reducing it to its experimental consequences.</p>

		<p>For Peirce a doctrine could be perfectly clear and yet false. This
		would be the case where one had a vivid idea of all the outcomes in
		experience involved by the idea, but yet was unable to prophesy any
		outcome that should be verified by future fact. Our idea of the object
		would not in that case ‘correspond to the reality’ in the sense of giving
		us a belief which could be ‘verified by all investigators’.</p>

		<p>Peirce, then, instead of having a radical and startling theory of
		truth to propose, would consider himself an ultra-conservative on the
		question of what shall be called truth. Approaching the matter from
		the standpoint of a scientist, (for he says in another connection that
		he had at this time spent most of his life in a laboratory), he is concerned
		only with an attempt to apply “the fruitful methods of science”
		<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>to “the barren field of metaphysics”. For metaphysics seems to him
		very much in need of outside help. His different conception of the
		two disciplines may be seen from the following passage. In contrast
		to philosophy, he is eulogizing the natural sciences, “where investigators,
		instead of condemning each the work of the others as misdirected from
		beginning to end, co-operate, stand upon one another’s shoulders, and
		multiply <ins title="incontestible">incontestable</ins> results; where every observation is repeated,
		and isolated observations count for little; where every hypothesis that
		merits attention is subjected to severe but fair examination, and only
		after the predictions to which it leads have been remarkably borne out
		by experience is trusted at all, and <ins title="when">then</ins> only provisionally; where a
		radically false step is rarely taken, even the most faulty of those
		theories which gain credence being true in their main <ins title="experiental">experiential</ins>
		predictions”.</p>

		<p>It is in a desire to elevate metaphysics to somewhere near this
		level that Peirce proposes his new theory of clearness, believing that
		much of the useless disputation of philosophy, as he sees it, will end
		when we know exactly what we are talking about according to this test.</p>

		<p>On the question of truth he might indeed have referred to another
		of his early articles, where the same idea of the independence of truth
		from individual opinion is brought out. The much-quoted paper on
		“How To Make Our Ideas Clear” was, as we have noted, the second
		of a series called “Illustrations of the Logic of Science”. In order to
		get his doctrine of truth more adequately before us, we may turn for
		a moment to the first article of the series, the paper called “The Fixation
		of Belief”.</p>

		<p>Here Peirce begins by pointing out four methods for fixing belief.
		In the first, or ‘method of tenacity’, one simply picks out the belief
		which for some reason he <em>desires</em>, and holds to it by closing his eyes
		to all evidence pointing the other way. The second, or the ‘method of
		authority’, is the same except that the individual is replaced by the
		state. The third, or ‘a priori method’, makes a thing true when it is
		‘agreeable to reason’. But this sort of truth varies between persons,
		for what is agreeable to reason is more or less a matter of taste.</p>

		<p>In contrast with these, and especially with the <em>a priori</em> method, a
		method must be discovered which will determine truth entirely apart
		from individual opinion. This is the method of science. That is, “To
		satisfy our doubt … it is necessary that a method should be found by
		which our beliefs may be caused by nothing human, but by some external
		permanency—by something upon which our thinking has no effect….
		It must be something which affects, or might affect, every man. And,
		though these affections are necessarily as various as are individual
		conditions, yet the method must be such that the ultimate conclusion
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>of every man shall be the same. Such is the method of science. Its
		fundamental hypothesis, restated in more familiar language, is this:
		There are real things whose characters are entirely independent of our
		opinions about them; those realities affect our senses according to regular
		laws, and, though our sensations are as different as our relations to the
		objects, yet, by taking advantage of the laws of perception, we can
		ascertain by reasoning how things really are, and any man, if he have
		sufficient experience, and reason enough about it, will be led to one
		true conclusion. The new conception here involved is that of reality.
		It may be asked how I know that there are any realities. If this
		hypothesis is the sole support of my method of inquiry, my method of
		inquiry must not be used to support my hypothesis. The reply is this:
		1. If investigation cannot be regarded as proving that there are real
		things, it at least does not lead to a contrary conclusion; but the method
		and conception on which it is based remain ever in harmony. No
		doubts of the method, therefore, arise with its practice, as is the case
		with all the others. 2. The feeling which gives rise to any method of
		fixing belief is a dissatisfaction at two repugnant propositions. But
		here already is a vague concession that there is some <em>one</em> thing to
		which a proposition should conform…. Nobody, therefore, can really
		doubt that there are realities, or, if he did, doubt would not be a source
		of dissatisfaction. The hypothesis, therefore, is one which every mind
		admits. So that the social impulse does not cause me to doubt it.
		3. Everybody uses the scientific method about a great many things,
		and only ceases to use it when he does not know how to apply it.
		4. Experience of the method has not led me to doubt it, but, on the
		contrary, scientific investigation has had the most wonderful triumphs
		in the way of settling opinion. These afford the explanation of my not
		doubting the method or the hypothesis which it supposes”. (p.12)</p>

		<p>The method of science, therefore, is procedure based on the
		hypothesis that there are realities independent of what we may think
		them to be. This, it seems, is what Peirce regards as the fundamental
		principle of the ‘logic of science’. This principle, stated here in the
		first paper, is again stated as we have seen, towards <ins title="th">the</ins> close of the
		second paper. There he says again, “All the followers of science are
		fully persuaded that the processes of investigation, if only pushed far
		enough, will give one certain solution to every question to which they
		can be applied…. Different minds may set out with the most antagonistic
		views, but the progress of investigation carries them by a
		force outside of themselves to one and the same conclusion…. This
		great law is embodied in the conception of truth and reality. That
		opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>is what we mean by truth, and the object represented in this opinion
		is the real. This is the way I would explain reality”. (p.300).</p>

		<p>It is well at this point to call attention to a distinction. It is to be
		noticed that in the first paper and in the latter part of the second he
		is talking of a method for attaining truth. But in the body of the
		second paper he is talking of a method for attaining clearness. These
		two should be kept distinct in our minds. The use of the various
		methods described for finding the velocity of light were endeavors to
		find the truth, not to make our ideas clear. Clearness and truth Peirce
		believes to have no invariable connection. He says in ending the article
		on “How To Make Our Ideas Clear”, “It is certainly important to
		know how to make our ideas clear, <em>but they may be ever so clear
		without being true</em>”. (p.302, italics mine.) There are, then, two
		methods under consideration: the scientific method for reaching truth,
		with its postulate that there are independent realities, and the logical
		method for securing clearness, which as he has just stated, has no
		necessary connection with truth.</p>

		<p>Now I should like to point out, in criticism, that these two methods
		cannot be used <ins title="togethehr">together</ins>, or rather that the postulate of the ‘scientific
		method’ will not endure the test proposed by the ‘method for clearness’.
		The scientific method postulates a reality unaffected by our opinions
		about it. But when we apply the method for clearness to this reality it
		seems to vanish.</p>

		<p>The process is this: Peirce, as we will remember, begins his discussion
		of the real by defining it as “that whose characters are independent
		of what anybody may think them to be.” Then passing on to
		apply his method for clearness he finds that “reality, like every other
		quality, consists in the peculiar sensible effects which things partaking
		of it produce”, and adds that “the only effects which real things have
		is to cause belief, for all the sensations which they excite emerge into
		consciousness in the form of beliefs”. Reality is the sum of its sensible
		effects, its sensible effects are beliefs, so reality is a sum of beliefs.</p>

		<p>Now, reality cannot be the sum of <em>all</em> beliefs regarding the real,
		because reality is defined in another connection as the object represented
		by a <em>true</em> opinion, and a true opinion is that which is fated to be agreed
		to after an investigation is complete. Reality then can consist only in
		certain selected beliefs. But if reality is this set of ultimately-adopted
		beliefs, what is truth itself? For truth has been defined as the beliefs
		which will be ultimately adopted.</p>

		<p>In other words, when Peirce applies his method for clearness to
		the concept of reality, he reduces reality to truth. He identifies the two.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>Then there remains no independent realty which stands as a <em>check</em>
		on truth. And this was the postulate of his method of science.</p>

		<p>Since the application of his own method for clearness eliminates
		reality, it looks as though Peirce must abandon either this method or
		the postulate of science. He cannot use both the method for clearness
		and the postulate of the method of science.</p>

		<p>We must remember that Peirce was a pioneer in this movement.
		And in making the transition from the older form of thought, he
		occasionally uses a word both in the old sense and in the new. Such
		would seem to be his difficulty with the word ‘reality’, which he uses
		both in the newer sense which the method for clearness would show
		it to have, and in the old orthodox sense of something absolute. When
		he says “reality … consists of the peculiar sensible effects which things
		partaking of it produce”, he seems to have the two senses of the word
		in one sentence. Reality consists in sensible effects, or it is that which is
		produced somehow by means of our senses. But, when things <em>partake</em>
		of reality, reality exists in advance and produces those effects. Reality
		is conceived both as the things produced and as the producer of these
		things.</p>

		<p>A somewhat similar difficulty occurs, as I may point out again in
		criticism, in the use of the words ‘meaning’ and ‘belief’. Here the confusion
		is caused, not by using a word in two senses, as in the case of
		‘reality’, but by using both the words ‘meaning’ and ‘belief’ in the same
		sense. Peirce defines both ‘meaning’ and ‘belief’ as a sum of habits,
		and indicates no difference between them.</p>

		<p>Thus he says of meaning, “There is no distinction of meaning so
		fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference in practice”. (293)
		“To develop its meaning, we have, therefore, simply to determine what
		habits it produces, for what a thing means is simply what habits it
		involves”. (p. 292).</p>

		<p>But he says similarly of belief, “Belief involves the establishment
		in our nature of a rule of action, or, say for short, of a habit”. “Since
		belief is a rule for action, it is a new starting point for thought”. “The
		essence of belief is the establishment of a habit, and different beliefs
		are distinguished by the different modes of action to which they give
		rise”. (p. 291).</p>

		<p>Now it will be agreed that instead of defining belief and meaning
		in terms of the same thing and thus identifying them, we ought sharply
		to distinguish between them. To have the meaning of a thing is not
		at all the same as to believe in it. Thus one may have clearly in mind
		the meaning of centaurs or of fairies or of any of the characters of
		mythology without in the slightest degree believing in them. Defining
		these things in terms of sensible effects, we could say that we know
		<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>their meaning in the sense that we understand which sensible effects
		would be involved if they did exist. But to have a belief about them
		would mean that we would <em>expect</em> these sensible effects. In other words,
		a belief involves the possibility of fulfillment or frustration of expectation.
		To believe in anything is therefore a distinct step beyond
		understanding it.</p>

		<p>In inserting these theories of reality and of belief in this discussion
		of a method for clear apprehension, Peirce is passing beyond a doctrine
		of clearness and involving himself in a doctrine of truth. We have
		seen that he does not seem to be able to maintain the postulated reality
		underlying his description of the scientific method for attaining truth.
		And it now seems that he is in equal difficulty with belief. If <em>meaning</em>
		is simply a sum of habits, belief is <em>not</em> simply a sum of habits, for the
		two are not the same. And if, as we have said, the quality that distinguishes
		belief from meaning is the fact that it involves expectation,
		then we appear to be on the verge of a new theory of truth,—a theory
		saying that truth is simply the fulfillment of these expectations.</p>

		<p>Such, we may note, is the interpretation that Dewey puts upon the
		pragmatic method,—such is the theory of truth that he finds involved
		in it.</p>

		<p>The interpretations of pragmatism which came particularly to the
		notice of Peirce, however, were those made by James and Schiller, and
		against these, we may say here, he made vigorous protest. These he
		regarded as perversions of his doctrine. And he was so desirous of
		indicating that his own theory of clearness involved for himself no such
		developments as these, that, in order to make the distinctions clear, he
		renamed his own doctrine.</p>

		<p>His first article of dissent, appearing in The Monist in 1905, was
		directed mainly, however, against the looseness of popular usage. He
		traces briefly the doctrine’s growth. Referring back to his original
		statement in 1878, he says of himself that he “framed the theory that a
		<em>conception</em>, that is, the rational purpose of a word or other expression,
		lies exclusively in its conceivable bearing upon the conduct of life; so
		that, since obviously nothing that might not result from experiment can
		have any direct bearing upon conduct, if one can define <ins title="acurately">accurately</ins> all
		the conceivably experimental phenomena which the affirmation or denial
		of a concept could imply, one will have therein a complete definition of
		the concept, and <em>there is absolutely nothing more in it</em>. For this doctrine
		he [Peirce, now speaking of himself] invented the name of pragmatism….
		His word ‘pragmatism’ has gained general recognition in a
		generalized sense that seems to argue power of growth and vitality.
		The famed psychologist, James, first took it up, seeing that his ‘radical
		empiricism’ substantially answered to the writer’s definition, albeit with
		<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>a certain difference in point of view. Next the admirably clear and
		brilliant thinker, Mr. Ferdinand C. S. Schiller, casting about for a more
		attractive name for the ‘anthropomorphism’ of his <em>Riddle of the Sphinx</em>,
		lit, in that most remarkable paper of his on Axioms as Postulates, upon
		the designation ‘pragmatism’, which in its original sense was in generic
		agreement with his own doctrine, for which he has since found the
		more appropriate specification ‘humanism’, while he still retains pragmatism
		in a somewhat wider sense. So far all went happily. But at
		present the word begins to be met with occasionally in the literary
		journals, where it gets abused in the merciless way that words have to
		expect when they fall into literary clutches. Sometimes the manners
		of the British have effloresced in scolding at the word as ill-chosen—ill-chosen,
		that is, to express some meaning that it was rather designed to
		exclude. So, then, the writer, finding his bantling ‘pragmatism’ so
		promoted, feels that it is time to kiss his child good-by and relinquish
		it in its higher destiny; while to serve the precise purpose of expressing
		the original definition, he begs to announce the birth of the word
		‘pragmaticism’, which is ugly enough to be safe from kidnappers”.
		(pp. 165-6).</p>

		<p>Three years later Peirce published an article of much more outspoken
		protest, this time including in his repudiation the professional
		philosophers as well as the popularists. Writing for the Hibbert Journal
		(v.7) he states his case as follows:</p>

		<p>“About forty years ago my studies of Kant, Berkeley, and others
		led me, after convincing myself that all thinking is performed in signs,
		and that mediation takes the form of dialogue, so that it is proper to
		speak of the ‘meaning’ of a concept, to conclude that to acquire full
		mastery of that meaning it is requisite, in the first place, to learn to
		recognize that concept under every disguise, through extensive familiarity
		with instances of it. But this, after all, does not imply any true
		understanding of it; so that it is further requisite that we should make
		an abstract logical analysis of it into its ultimate elements, or as complete
		an analysis as we can compass. But even so, we may still be
		without any living comprehension of it; and the only way to complete
		our knowledge of its nature is to discover and recognize just what
		habits of conduct a belief in the truth of the concept (of any conceivable
		subject, and under any conceivable circumstances) would reasonably
		develop; that is to say, what habits would ultimately result from a sufficient
		consideration of such truth. It is necessary to understand the
		word ‘conduct’, here, in the broadest sense. If, for example, the predication
		of a given concept were to lead to our admitting that a given form
		of reasoning concerning the subject of which it was affirmed was valid,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>when it would not otherwise be valid, the recognition of that effect in
		our reasoning would decidedly be a habit of conduct”. (p.108).</p>

		<p>After referring to his own expositions he continues, “… But in
		1897 Professor James remodelled the matter, and transmogrified it into
		a doctrine of philosophy, some parts of which I highly approved, while
		other and more prominent parts I regarded, and still regard, as opposed
		to sound logic. About the same time Professor Papirie discovered, to
		the delight of the Pragmatist school, that this doctrine was incapable of
		definition, which would certainly seem to distinguish it from every other
		doctrine in whatever branch of science, I was coming to the conclusion
		that my poor little maxim should be called by another name; and I accordingly,
		in April 1905, renamed it Pragmaticism.” (p.109).</p>

		<p>“My original essay, having been written for a popular monthly,
		assumes, for no better reason than that real inquiry cannot begin until
		a state of real doubt arises, and ends as soon as a real Belief is attained,
		that a ‘settlement of belief’, or in other words, a <em>state of satisfaction</em>,
		is all that Truth, or the aim of inquiry, consists in. The reason I gave
		for this was so flimsy, while the inference was so nearly the gist of Pragmaticism,
		that I must confess the argument of that essay might be said
		with some justice to beg the question. The first part of the essay is
		occupied, however, with showing that, if Truth consists in satisfaction,
		it cannot be any <em>actual</em> satisfaction, but must be the satisfaction that
		would ultimately be found if the inquiry were pushed to its ultimate and
		indefeasible issue. This, I beg to point out, is a very different position
		from that of Mr. Schiller and the pragmatists of to-day…. Their
		avowedly undefinable position, if it be not capable of logical characterization,
		seems to me to be characterized by an angry hatred of
		strict logic, and even a disposition to rate any exact thought which
		interferes with their doctrine as all humbug. At the same time it seems
		to me clear that their approximate acceptance of the Pragmaticistic
		principle, and even that very casting aside of difficult distinctions (although
		I cannot approve of it), has helped them to a mightily clear discernment
		of some fundamental truths that other philosophers have seen
		but through a mist, or most of them not at all. Among such truths,—all
		of them old, of course, yet acknowledged by few—I reckon their denial
		of necessitarianism; their rejection of any ‘consciousness’ different from
		a visceral or other external sensation; their acknowledgment that there
		are, in a Pragmatistical sense, Real habits … and their insistence upon
		interpreting all hypostatic abstractions in terms of what they <em>would</em>
		or <em>might</em> (not actually <em>will</em>) come to in the concrete. It seems to me a
		pity that they should allow a philosophy so instinct with life to become
		infected with seeds of death in such notions as that of the unreality of all
		ideas of infinity and that of the mutability of truth, and in such confusions
		<a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>of thought as that of active willing (willing to control thought,
		to doubt, and to weigh reasons) with willing not to exert the will (willing
		to believe)”. (pp.111, 112).</p>

		<p>The difference between the position of Peirce and of James may be
		stated in another way as constituted by the fact that James introduces
		the factor of <em>value</em> as a criterion for meaning and for truth, while for
		Peirce these elements did not enter the question at all. For James the
		value of a belief is an apparent evidence for its truth, while for Peirce
		value had no relation to truth. For an account of this development of
		the pragmatic doctrine we pass on now to a discussion of James.</p>

		The Interpretation Given to Pragmatism by James.</h2>

		<p>James first uses the term ‘pragmatism’, as Peirce had done, to refer
		to a method for attaining clearness. When, in 1898, he brought again
		before the public the original article by Peirce, he was simply expounding
		the Peircian doctrine without making any attempt to pass beyond it.
		But, as we have just seen, he later gave it a construction, an interpretation
		as a theory of truth, with which its originator could not agree. In this
		chapter we may, therefore, look first at his exposition of the doctrine
		of clearness, and after that, in order to understand James’ development
		of the doctrine into a theory of truth, we may turn back for a moment
		to some of his previous publications on the question of truth. It will
		then be possible to trace chronologically his developing attitude toward
		the truth controversy. From this we may pass finally to an indication
		of some of the difficulties in which he becomes involved. The most
		important of these, it may be said again, is that he construes the test of
		truth of an idea to be, not merely that the idea leads to expected consequences,
		but that it leads to predominantly desirable consequences. The
		outcomes which stand as evidence for truth are then not merely outcomes
		bringing fulfilled expectations but outcomes bringing happiness.</p>

		<h3 id="section2-1" class="section_title">James’ Exposition of Peirce.</h3>

		<p>James in expounding the doctrine of Peirce explains the pragmatic
		principle as a method of investigating philosophic controversies, reducing
		them to essentials (clear meanings), and selecting those worthy of discussion.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="“The Pragmatic Method”..." class="fnmarker">2</a>
		“Suppose”, he says, “that there are two different philosophical
		definitions, or propositions, or maxims, or what not, which seem to contradict
		each other, and about which men dispute. If, by assuming the
		truth of the one, you can foresee no practical consequence to anybody,
		at any time or place, which is different from what you would foresee if
		you assumed the truth of the other, why then the difference between the
		two propositions is no real difference—it is only a specious and verbal
		difference, unworthy of future contention…. There can <em>be</em> no difference
		which does not <em>make</em> a difference—no difference in the abstract truth
		which does not express itself in a difference of concrete fact, and of
		conduct consequent upon that fact, imposed upon somebody, somehow,
		somewhere and somewhen…. The whole function of philosophy ought
		to be to find out what definite difference it would make to you and me,
		at definite instants of our life, if this world-formula or that world-formula
		be the one which is true”. (p.675).</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>This doctrine is illustrated by using it to secure the essence of two
		philosophical questions, materialism vs. theism and the one <em>vs.</em> the many.
		If we suppose for an instant, he suggests, that this moment is the last
		moment of the universe’s existence, there will be no <em>difference</em> between
		materialism and theism. All the effects that might be ascribed to either
		have come about.</p>

		<p>“These facts are in, are bagged, are captured; and the good that’s in
		them is gained, be the atom or be the God their cause.” (p. 677). “The
		God, if there, has been doing just what the atom could do—appearing
		in the character of atoms, so to speak, and earning such gratitude as is
		due to atoms, and no more”. Future good or ill is ruled out by
		postulate. Taken thus retrospectively, there could be no difference between
		materialism and theism.</p>

		<p>But taken prospectively, they point to wholly different consequences.
		“For, according to the theory of mechanical evolution, the
		laws of redistribution of matter and motion, though they are certainly
		to thank for all the good hours which our organisms have ever yielded
		us and all the ideals which our minds now frame, are yet fatally certain
		to undo their work again, and to redissolve everything that they have
		evolved…. We make complaint of |materialism| for what it is <em>not</em>—not
		a permanent warrant for our more ideal interests, not a fulfiller of our
		remotest hopes…. Materialism means simply the denial that the moral
		order is eternal, and the cutting off of ultimate hopes; theism means the
		affirmation of an eternal moral order and the letting loose of hope.
		Surely here is an issue genuine enough for anyone who feels it….</p>

		<p>“[And] if there be a God, it is not likely that he is confined solely
		to making differences in the world’s latter end; he probably makes differences
		all along its course. Now the principle of practicalism says
		that that very meaning of the conception of God lies in the differences
		which must be made in experience if the conception be true. God’s
		famous inventory of perfections, as elaborated by dogmatic theology,
		either means nothing, says our principle, or it implies certain definite
		things that we can feel and do at certain definite moments of our lives,
		things that we could not feel and should not do were no God present
		and were the business of the universe carried on by material atoms instead.
		So far as our conceptions of the Deity involve no such experiences,
		they are meaningless and verbal,—scholastic entities and abstractions,
		as the positivists say, and fit objects for their scorn. But so far
		as they do involve such definite experiences, God means something for
		us, and may be real”. (pp.678-680).</p>

		<p>The second illustration of the pragmatic principle—the supposed
		opposition between the One and the Many—may be treated more briefly.
		James suggests certain definite and practical sets of results in which to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>define ‘oneness’, and tries out the conception to see whether this result
		or that is what oneness means. He finds this method to clarify the
		difficulty here as well as in the previous case. In summarizing he says:
		“I have little doubt myself that this old quarrel might be completely
		smoothed out to the satisfaction of all claimants, if only the maxim of
		Peirce were methodically followed here. The current monism on the
		whole still keeps talking in too abstract a way. It says that the world
		must either be pure disconnectedness, no universe at all, or absolute
		unity. It insists that there is no stopping-place half-way. Any connection
		whatever, says this monism, is only possible if there be still more
		connection, until at last we are driven to admit the absolutely total connection
		required. But this absolutely total connection either means
		nothing, is the mere word ‘one’ spelt long, or else it means the sum of
		all the partial connections that can possibly be conceived. I believe that
		when we thus attack the question, and set ourselves to search for these
		possible connections, and conceive each in a definite and practical way,
		the dispute is already in a fair way to be settled beyond the chance of
		misunderstanding, by a compromise in which the Many and the One
		both get their lawful rights”. (p. 685).</p>

		<p>In concluding, James relates Peirce to the English Empiricists, asserting
		that it was they “who first introduced the custom of interpreting
		the meaning of conceptions by asking what differences they make for
		life…. The great English way of investigating a conception is to ask
		yourself right off, ‘What is it known as? In what facts does it result?
		What is its <em>cash-value</em> in terms of particular experience? And what
		special difference would come into the world according as it were true
		or false?<ins title="missing">’</ins> Thus does Locke treat the conception of personal identity.
		What you mean by it is just your chain of memories, says he…. So
		Berkeley with his ‘matter’. The cash-value of matter is just our physical
		sensations…. Hume does the same thing with causation. It is known
		as habitual antecedence…. Stewart and Brown, James Mill, John Mill,
		and Bain, have followed more or less consistently the same method; and
		Shadworth Hodgson has used it almost as explicitly as Mr. Peirce….
		The short-comings and negations and the baldnesses of the English
		philosophers in question come, not from their eye to merely practical
		results, but solely from their failure to track the practical results completely
		enough to see how far they extend”. (pp. 685-6).</p>

		<p class="post-thoughtbreak">It will be at once observed that James, as well as Peirce, is at this
		point saying nothing about a new doctrine of truth, but is concerning
		himself only with a new doctrine of clearness. Meaning and clearness
		of meanings are his only topics in this paper. Thus he states, “The only

		of perfection … either <em>means</em> nothing, says our principle, or it implies
		certain definite things that we can feel and do at certain definite moments
		in our lives”. And again in speaking of the pluralism-monism controversy,
		“Any connection whatever, says this monism, is only possible
		if there be still more connection, until at last we are driven to admit
		the absolutely total connection required. But this absolutely total connection
		either <em>means</em> nothing, is the mere word ‘one’ spelt long, or else
		it means the sum of all the partial connections….”</p>

		<p>But as we all know, James did afterward embrace the new pragmatic
		theory of truth. While he did not in 1898 use the word pragmatism
		to designate anything except a new method for securing clearness,
		yet it can be shown that he had been developing another line of
		thought, since a much earlier date, which did lead quite directly toward
		the pragmatic theory of truth. It may be well at this point then to go
		back and trace the growth of this idea of truth through such writing
		as he had done before this time. It will be found, I think, that James’
		whole philosophic tendency to move away from the transcendental and
		unitary toward the particular was influencing him towards this new conception.</p>

		<h3 id="section2-2" class="section_title">Development of the Doctrine through the Earlier Writings of James.</h3>

		<p>The first article which James wrote on truth, as he later states,<a href="#footnote_3" id="fnm3" title="“The Meaning of Truth”..." class="fnmarker">3</a> was
		entitled “The Function of Cognition”, and was published in <em>Mind</em> in
		1885. Commenting on this article in 1909 he asserts that many of the
		essential theses of the book “Pragmatism”, published twenty-two years
		later, were already to be found here, and that the difference is mainly
		one of emphasis.<a href="#footnote_4" id="fnm4" title="Same, p. 137." class="fnmarker">4</a></p>

		<p>This article attempts to give a description of knowing as it actually
		occurs,—not how it originated nor how it is antecedently possible. The
		thesis is that an idea knows an external reality when it points to it, resembles
		it, and is able to affect it. The plan of exposition is to start with
		the simplest imaginable material and then gradually introduce additional
		matter as it is needed until we have cognition as it actually occurs.
		James postulates a single, momentarily-existing, floating feeling as the
		entire content, at the instant, of the universe. What, then, can this
		momentary feeling know? Calling it a ‘feeling of <em>q</em>’, it can be made any
		particular feeling (fragrance, pain, hardness) that the reader likes. We
		see, first, that the feeling cannot properly be said to know itself. There
		is no inner duality of the knower on the one hand and content or known
		<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>on the other. “If the content of the feeling occurs nowhere else in the
		universe outside of the feeling itself, and perish with the feeling, common
		usage refuses to call it a reality, and brands it as a subjective feature
		of the feeling’s constitution, or at most as the feeling’s dream. For the
		feeling to be cognitive in the specific sense, then, it must be self-transcendent”.
		And we must therefore “create a reality outside of it to correspond
		to the intrinsic quality <em>q</em>”. This can stand as the first complication
		of that universe. Agreeing that the feeling cannot be said to know
		itself, under what conditions does it know the external reality? James
		replies, “If the newly-created reality <em>resemble</em> the feeling’s quality <em>q</em>, I
		say that the feeling may be held by us to be <em>cognizant of that reality</em>”.
		It may be objected that a momentary feeling cannot properly know a
		thing because it has no <em>time</em> to become aware of any of the <em>relations</em> of
		the thing. But this rules out only one of the kinds of knowledge, namely
		“knowledge about” the thing; knowledge as direct acquaintance remains.
		We may then assert that “if there be in the universe a <em>q</em> other than the <em>q</em>
		in the feeling the latter may have acquaintance with an entity ejective
		to itself; an acquaintance moreover, which, as mere acquaintance it
		would be hard to imagine susceptible either of improvement or increase,
		being in its way complete; and which would oblige us (so long as we
		refuse not to call acquaintance knowledge) to say not only that the
		feeling is cognitive, but that all qualities <em>of feeling, so long as there is
		anything outside of them which they resemble</em>, are feelings of qualities
		of existence, and perceptions of outward fact”. But this would be true,
		as unexceptional rule, only in our artificially simplified universe. If
		there were a number of different <em>q’s</em> for the feeling to resemble, while
		it meant only one of them, there would obviously be something more
		than resemblance in the case of the one which it did know. This fact,
		that resemblance is not enough in itself to constitute knowledge, can be
		seen also from remembering that many feelings which do resemble
		each other closely,—e. g., toothaches—do not on that account know each
		other. Really to know a thing, a feeling must not only resemble the
		thing, but must also be able to act on it. In brief, “the feeling of <em>q</em>
		knows whatever reality it resembles, and either directly or indirectly
		operates on. If it resemble without operating, it is a dream; if it
		operates without resembling, it is an error”. Such is the formula for
		perceptual knowledge. Concepts must be reduced to percepts, after
		which the same rule holds. We may say, to make the formula complete,
		“A percept knows whatever reality it directly or indirectly operates on
		and resembles; a conceptual feeling, or thought, knows a reality, whenever
		it actually or potentially terminates in a percept that operates on, or
		resembles that reality, or is otherwise connected with it or with its
		context”.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>“The latter percept [the one to which the concept has been reduced]
		may be either sensation or sensorial idea; and when I say the thought
		must <em>terminate</em> in such a percept, I mean that it must ultimately be
		capable of leading up thereto,—by way of practical experience if the
		terminal feeling be a sensation; by way of logical or habitual suggestion,
		if it be only an image in the <ins title="mand">mind</ins>”. “These percepts, these <em>termini</em>,
		these sensible things, these mere matters of acquaintance, are the only
		realities we ever directly know, and the whole history of our thought is
		the history of our substitution of one of them for the other, and the
		reduction of the substitute to the status of a conceptual sign. Condemned
		though they be by some thinkers, these sensations are the mother-earth,
		the anchorage, the stable rock, the first and last limits, the <em>terminus
		a quo</em> and the <em>terminus ad quem</em> of the mind. To find such sensational
		termini should be our aim with all our higher thought. They end discussion;
		they destroy the false conceit of knowledge; and without them
		we are all at sea with each other’s meanings…. We can never be sure
		we understand each other till we are able to bring the matter to this
		test. This is why metaphysical discussions are so much like fighting
		with the air; they have no practical issue of a sensational kind. Scientific
		theories, on the other hand, always terminate in definite percepts.
		You can deduce a possible sensation from your theory and, taking me
		into your laboratory prove that your theory is true of my world by
		giving me the sensation then and there”.</p>

		<p>At this point James quotes, in substantiation, the following passage
		from Peirce’s article of 1878: “There is no distinction in meaning so
		fine as to consist in anything but a possible difference in practice…. It
		appears, then, that the rule for attaining the highest grade of clearness
		of apprehension is as follows: Consider what effects, which might
		conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception
		to have. Then our conception of these effects is the whole of
		our conception of the object.”</p>

		<p>In this early paper of James’ are to be found foreshadowings of
		pragmatism both as a method and as a theory of truth. Pragmatism
		as a method is shown in the whole discussion of the primacy of sensations
		and of the necessity for reducing conceptions to perceptions. This
		is exactly in line with the pragmatism proposed by Peirce in 1878 and
		here quoted from by James. Pragmatism as a theory of truth is anticipated
		by the proposal that the idea knows, and knows truly, the reality
		which it is able to make changes in. The idea <em>proves</em> its reference to
		a given reality by making these specified changes. It is antecedently
		true only if it can bring about these changes. The next step is to say
		that its truth <em>consists</em> in its ability to forecast and bring to pass these
		<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>changes. Then we have pragmatism as a theory of truth. James did
		not take this step, as we shall see, until after 1904.</p>

		<p>There is also a suggestion of the ‘subjectivity’ of James’ later theory
		of truth, which would differentiate him even at this time from Peirce on
		the question of truth. He has said that a true idea must indeed resemble
		reality, but who, he asks, is to determine what is real? He answers that
		an idea is true when it resembles something which I, as critic, <em>think</em> to be
		reality. “When [the enquirer] finds that the feeling that he is studying
		contemplates what he himself regards as a reality he must of course
		admit the feeling itself to be truly cognitive”. Peirce would say that
		the idea is not true unless it points to a reality that would be found by <em>all</em>
		investigators, quite irrespective of what the <em>one</em> person acting as critic
		may think. James and Pierce would therefore, begin to diverge even at
		this early date on the truth question. As to what constitutes clearness,
		they are in agreement.</p>

		<p>Something of the same idea is stated again four years later in an
		article which appeared in Mind<a href="#footnote_5" id="fnm5" title="“The Psychology of Belief”..." class="fnmarker">5</a> and which was republished the following
		year as a chapter of the Principles of Psychology.<a href="#footnote_6" id="fnm6" title="Vol. II, chapter XXI." class="fnmarker">6</a> One passage will
		show the general trend; “A conception to prevail, must <em>terminate</em> in a
		world of orderly experience. A rare phenomenon, to displace frequent
		ones, must belong with others more frequent still. The history of science
		is strewn with wrecks and ruins of theory—essences and principles,
		fluids and forces—once fondly clung to, but found to hang together with
		no facts of sense. The exceptional phenomena solicit our belief in vain
		until such time as we chance to conceive of them as of kinds already
		admitted to exist. What science means by ‘verification’ is no more than
		this, that <em>no object of conception shall be believed which sooner or later
		has not some permanent object of sensation for its term</em>…. Sensible
		vividness or pungency is then the vital factor in reality when once the
		conflict between objects, and the connecting of them together in the
		mind, has begun.”  (Italics mine).</p>

		<p>And in another connection he expresses the idea as follows: “Conceptual
		systems which neither began nor left off in sensations would be
		like bridges without piers. Systems about fact must plunge themselves
		into sensations as bridges plunge themselves into the rock. Sensations
		are the stable rock, the <em>terminus a quo</em> and the <em>terminus ad quem</em> of
		thought. To find such termini is our aim with all our theories—-to
		conceive first when and where a certain sensation may be had and then
		to have it. Finding it stops discussion. Failure to find it kills the false
		conceit of knowledge. Only when you deduce a possible sensation for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>me from your theory, and give it to me when and where the theory requires,
		do I begin to be sure that your thought has anything to do with
		truth.” (11:7).</p>

		<p>In 1902 James contributed to the “Dictionary of Philosophy and
		Psychology” published by J. Mark Baldwin the following definition for
		Pragmatism.</p>

		<p>“The doctrine that the whole ‘meaning’ of a conception expresses
		itself in practical consequences, consequences either in the shape of
		conduct to be recommended, or in that of experience to be expected,
		if the conception be true; which consequences would be different if it
		were untrue, and must be different from the consequences by which
		the meaning of other conceptions is in turn expressed. If a second conception
		should not appear to have either consequences, then it must
		really be only the first conception under a different name. In methodology
		it is certain that to trace and compare their respective consequences
		is an admirable way of establishing the different meanings of different
		conceptions”.</p>

		<p>It will be seem that James has not in 1902 differentiated between
		pragmatism as a method and as a theory of truth. Leaving out the one
		reference to truth, the definition is an excellent statement of the Peircian
		doctrine of clearness. This is especially to be noticed in the last two
		sentences, which are perfectly ‘orthodox’ statements of method alone.</p>

		<p>In 1904 and 1905 James published two papers in Mind on the
		truth question. The first, “Humanism and Truth”, may be called his
		‘border-line’ article. In this he is attempting to give a sympathetic
		interpretation of the humanistic theory of truth—which he later said
		is exactly like his own—but is still making the interpretation as an outsider.
		In the second article he has definitely embraced the humanistic
		theory and is defending it.</p>

		<p>The first article begins as follows:<a href="#footnote_7" id="fnm7" title="Mind, N. S. 13, p. 457." class="fnmarker">7</a> “Receiving from the editor of
		Mind an advance proof of Mr. Bradley’s article for July on ‘Truth and
		Practice’, I understand this as a hint to me to join in the controversy
		over ‘Pragmatism’ which seems to have seriously begun. As my name
		has been coupled with the movement, I deem it wise to take the hint,
		the more so as in some quarters greater credit has been given me than
		I deserve, and probably undeserved discredit in other quarters falls also
		to my lot.</p>

		<p>“First, as to the word ‘pragmatism’. I myself have only used the
		term to indicate a method of carrying on abstract discussion. The
		serious meaning of a concept, says Mr. Peirce, lies in the concrete difference
		to someone which its being true will make. Strive to bring all
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>debated questions to that ‘pragmatic’ test, and you will escape vain
		wrangling: if it can make no practical difference which of two statements
		be true, then they are really one statement in two verbal forms;
		if it can make no practical difference whether a given statement be true
		or false, then the statement has no real meaning. In neither case is
		there anything fit to quarrel about; we may save our breath, and pass
		to more important things.</p>

		<p>“All that the pragmatic method implies, then, is that truths should
		<em>have</em> practical consequences. In England the word has been used more
		broadly, to cover the notion that the truth of any statement consists in
		the consequences, and particularly in their being good consequences.
		Here we get beyond affairs of method altogether; and since this pragmatism
		and the wider pragmatism are so different, and both are important
		enough to have different names, I think that Mr. Schiller’s
		proposal to call the wider pragmatism by the name of ‘Humanism’ is
		excellent and ought to be adopted. The narrower pragmatism may still
		be spoken of as the ‘pragmatic method’.</p>

		<p>“If further egotism be in order. I may say that the account of truth
		given by Messrs. Sturt and Schiller and by Professor Dewey and his
		school … goes beyond any theorizing which I personally had ever indulged
		in until I read their writings. After reading these, <em>I feel almost
		sure that these authors are right in their main contentions</em>, but the
		originality is wholly theirs, and I can hardly recognize in my own humble
		doctrine that concepts are teleological instruments anything considerable
		enough to warrant my being called, as I have been, the ‘father’ of so
		important a movement forward in philosophy”.<a href="#footnote_8" id="fnm8" title="This paragraph appears as a footnote." class="fnmarker">8</a> (Italic mine).</p>

		<p>“I think that a decided effort at a sympathetic mental play with
		humanism is the provisional attitude to be recommended to the reader.</p>

		<p>“<em>When I find myself playing sympathetically with humanism</em>, something
		like what follows is what I end by conceiving it to mean”. (Italics
		mine).</p>

		<p>Such is the conservative tone in which the article is begun. Yet
		before it is ended we find these passages: “It seems obvious that the
		pragmatic account of all this routine of phenomenal knowledge is accurate”.
		(p.468). “The humanism, for instance, which I see and try
		<ins title="to">so</ins> hard to defend, is the completest truth attained from my point of
		view up to date”. (p.472).</p>

		<p>In a supplementary article, “Humanism and Truth Once More”,
		published a few months later in answer to questions prompted by this
		one, the acceptance of humanism is entirely definite. And here James
		<a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26"> </a>finds that he has been advocating the doctrine for several years. He
		says, “I myself put forth on several occasions a radically pragmatist
		account of knowledge”. (Mind, v. 14, p. 196). And again he remarks,
		“When following Schiller and Dewey, I define the true as that which
		gives the maximal combination of satisfaction …”. (p.196).</p>

		<h3 id="section2-3" class="section_title">The Theory of Truth in ‘Pragmatism’ and ‘The Meaning of Truth’.</h3>

		<p>In 1907 when he published his book “Pragmatism”, James, as we
		all know, was willing to accept the new theory of truth unreservedly.
		The hesitating on the margin, the mere interpreting of other’s views,
		are things of the past. From 1907 James’ position toward pragmatism
		as a truth-theory is unequivocal.</p>

		<p>Throughout the book, as I should like to point out, James is using
		‘pragmatism’ in two senses, and ‘truth’ in two senses. The two meanings
		of pragmatism he recognizes himself, and points out clearly the
		difference between pragmatism as a method for attaining clearness in
		our ideas and pragmatism as a theory of the truth or falsity of those
		ideas. But the two meanings of ‘truth’ he does not distinguish. And
		it is here that he differs from Dewey, as we shall presently see. He
		differed from Peirce on the question of the meaning of pragmatism—as
		to whether it could be developed to include a doctrine of truth as well as
		of clearness. He differs from Dewey on the question of ‘truth’—as to
		whether truth shall be used in both of the two specified senses or only
		in one of them.</p>

		<p><span id="subsection2-3-1" class="subsection_title">The Ambiguity of ‘Satisfaction’</span>—The double meaning of truth in
		James’ writing at this date may be indicated in this way: While truth
		is to be defined in terms of satisfaction, what is satisfaction? Does it
		mean that I am to be satisfied <em>of</em> a certain quality in the idea, or that I
		am to be satisfied <em>by</em> it? In other words, is the criterion of truth the
		fact that the idea leads as it promised or is it the fact that its leading,
		whether just as it promised or not, is desirable? Which, in short, are
		we to take as truth,—fulfilled expectations or value of results?</p>

		<p>It is in failing to distinguish between these two that James involves
		himself, I believe, in most of his difficulties, and it is in the recognition
		and explicit indication of this difference that Dewey differentiates himself
		from James. We may pass on to cite specific instances in which
		James uses each of these criteria. We will find, of course, that there
		are passages which can be interpreted as meaning either value or fulfillment,
		but there are many in which the use of value as a criterion seems
		unmistakable.</p>

		<p>The following quotations may be instanced: “If theological views
		prove to have value for concrete life, they will be true, for pragmatism,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>in the sense of being good for so much. For how much more they are
		true, will depend entirely on their relation to the other truths that have
		also to be acknowledged”. For example, in so far as the Absolute
		affords comfort, it is not sterile; “it has that amount of value; it performs
		a concrete function. I myself ought to call the Absolute true
		‘in so far forth’, then; and I unhesitatingly now do so”. (p.72).</p>

		<p>“On pragmatic principles, if the hypothesis of God works satisfactorily
		in the widest sense of the word, it is true. Now whatever
		its residual difficulties may be, experience shows that it certainly does
		work, and that the problem is to build out and determine it so that it
		will combine satisfactorily with all the other working truths”. (p. 299).</p>

		<p>“The true is the name for whatever proves itself to be good in the
		way of belief, and good, too, for definite, assignable reasons”. (p. 76).</p>

		<p>“Empirical psychologists … have denied the soul, save as the name
		for verifiable cohesions in our inner life. They redescend into the
		stream of experience with it, and cash it into so much small-change
		value in the way of ‘ideas’ and their connections with each other. The
		soul is good or ‘<em>true</em>’ for just so much, but no more”. (p. 92, italics mine).</p>

		<p>“Since almost any object may some day become temporarily important,
		the advantage of having a stock of extra truths, of ideas that
		shall be true of merely possible situations, is obvious…. Whenever such
		extra truths become practically relevant to one of our emergencies, it
		passes from cold storage to do work in the world and our belief in it
		grows active. You can say of it then either that <em>’it is useful because it
		is true’ or that it is ‘true because it is useful’</em>. <em>Both these phrases mean
		exactly the same thing</em>…. From this simple cue pragmatism gets her
		general notion of truth as something essentially bound up with the way
		in which one moment in our experience may lead us towards other
		moments <em>which it will be worth while to have been led to</em>. Primarily,
		and on the common-sense level, the truth of a state of mind means this
		function of <em>a leading that is worth while</em>”. (pp. 204-205, italics mine).</p>

		<p>“To ‘agree’ in the widest sense with reality can only mean to be
		guided either straight up to it or into its surroundings, or to be put into
		such working touch with it as to handle either it or something connected
		with it better than if we disagreed. <em>Better either intellectually or
		practically!…</em> An idea that helps us to deal, whether <em>practically or
		intellectually</em>, with either reality or its belongings, that doesn’t entangle
		our progress in frustrations, that fits, in fact, and adapts our life to the
		reality’s whole setting, will——hold true of that reality”. (pp. 212-213).</p>

		<p>“‘The true’, to put it very briefly, is only the expedient in the way
		of our thinking, just as the ‘right’ is only the expedient in the way of
		our behaving. <em>Expedient in almost any fashion</em>; and expedient in the
		long run and on the whole of course”. (p. 222).</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>We may add a passage with the same bearing, from “The Meaning
		of Truth”. In this quotation James is retracting the statement made
		in the University of California Address that without the future there
		is no difference between theism and materialism. He says: “Even if
		matter could do every outward thing that God does, the idea of it would
		not work as satisfactorily, because the chief call for a God on modern
		men’s part is for a being who will inwardly recognize them and judge
		them sympathetically. Matter disappoints this craving of our ego, and
		so God remains for most men the truer hypothesis, and indeed remain
		so for definite pragmatic reasons”. (p. 189, notes).</p>

		<p>The contrast between ‘intellectual’ and ‘practical’ seems to make
		his position certain. If truth is tested by practical workings, <em>as contrasted
		with</em> intellectual workings, it cannot be said to be limited to fulfilled
		expectation.</p>

		<p>The statement that the soul is good <em>or</em> true shows the same thing.
		The relation of truth to extraneous values is here beyond question.
		The other passages all bear, more or less obviously, in the same direction.</p>

		<p>As James keeps restating his position, there are many of the definitions
		that could be interpreted to mean either values or fulfillments, and
		even a few which seem to refer to fulfillment alone. The two following
		examples can be taken to mean either:</p>

		<p>“‘Truth’ in our ideas and beliefs means … that ideas (which
		themselves are but parts of our experience) become true just in so far
		as they help us to get into satisfactory relation with other parts of our
		experience, to summarize them and get about among them by conceptual
		short-cuts instead of following the interminable succession of
		particular phenomena. Any idea upon which we can ride, so to speak;
		any idea that will carry  us prosperously from one part of our experience
		to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securely,
		simplifying, saving labor, is true for just so much, true in so far forth,
		true instrumentally”. (p.58).</p>

		<p>“A new opinion counts as true just in proportion as it gratifies the
		individual’s desire to assimilate the novel in his experience to his beliefs
		in stock. It must both lean on old truth and grasp new fact; and its success
		… in doing this, is a matter for individual appreciation. When
		old truth grows, then, by new truth’s addition, it is for subjective reasons.
		We are in the process and obey the reasons. The new idea is truest
		which performs most felicitously its function of satisfying this double
		urgency. It makes itself true, gets itself classed as true, by the way it
		works.” (p.64).</p>

		<p>But we can turn from these to a paragraph in which truth seems
		to be limited to fulfilled expectations alone.</p>

		<p>“True ideas are those which we can assimilate, validate, corroborate,
		<a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>and verify. False ideas are those which we cannot. That is the practical
		difference it makes to us to have true ideas; that, therefore, is the
		meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known as….</p>

		<p>“But what do validation and verification themselves pragmatically
		mean? They again signify certain practical consequences of the verified
		and validated idea…. They head us … through the acts and other
		ideas which they instigate, into or up to, or towards, other parts of experience
		with which we feel all the while … that the original ideas remain
		in agreement. The connections and transitions come to us from
		point to point as being progressive, harmonious, satisfactory. This
		function of agreeable leading is what we mean by an idea’s verification”.
		(pp.201-202).</p>

		<p><span id="subsection2-3-2" class="subsection_title">The Relation of Truth to Utility</span>—It seems certain from the
		foregoing that James means, at least at certain times, to define the true
		in terms of the valuable. Satisfaction he is using as satisfaction <em>by</em>
		rather than satisfaction <em>of</em>. As we have pointed out, one may be satisfied
		of the correctness of one’s idea without being at all satisfied by it.
		This distinction has been most clearly set forth by Boodin, in his discussion
		of ‘What pragmatism is not’, in the following words: “The truth
		satisfaction may run counter to any moral or esthetic satisfaction in the
		particular case. It may consist in the discovery that the friend we had
		backed had involved us in financial failure, that the picture we had
		bought from the catalogue description is anything but beautiful. But
		we are no longer uncertain as regards the truth. Our restlessness, so
		far as that particular curiosity is concerned, has come to an end”.<a href="#footnote_9" id="fnm9" title="Boodin: Truth and Reality..." class="fnmarker">9</a></p>

		<p>It is clear then, that the discovery of truth is not to be identified
		with a predominantly satisfactory state of mind at the moment. Our
		state of mind at the moment may have only a grain of satisfaction, yet
		this is of so unique a kind and so entirely distinguishable from the other
		contents of the mind that it is perfectly practicable as a criterion. It is
		simply “the cessation of the irritation of a doubt”, as Peirce puts it, or
		the feeling that my idea has led as it promised. The feeling of fulfilled
		expectation is thus a very distinct and recognizable <em>part</em> of the whole
		general feeling commonly described as ‘satisfaction’. When ‘utility’ in
		our ideas, therefore, means a momentary feeling of dominant satisfaction,
		truth cannot be identified with it.</p>

		<p>And neither, as I wish now to point out, can truth be identified
		with utility when utility means a long-run satisfactoriness, or satisfactoriness
		of the idea for a considerable number of people through a considerable
		period of time. The same objection arises here which we
		noted a moment ago—that the satisfaction may be quite indifferent to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>the special satisfaction arising from tests. As has been often shown,
		many ideas are satisfactory for a long period of time simply because
		they are <em>not</em> subjected to tests. “A hope is not a hope, a fear is not a
		fear, once either is recognized as unfounded…. A delusion is delusion
		only so long as it is not known to be one. A mistake can be built upon
		only so long as it is not suspected”.</p>

		<p>Some actual delusions which were not readily subjected to tests
		have been long useful in this way. “For instance, basing ourselves on
		Lafcadio Hearn, we might quite admit that the opinions summed up
		under the title ‘Ancestor-Worship’ had been … ‘exactly what was required’
		by the former inhabitants of Japan”. “It was good for primitive
		man to believe that dead ancestors required to be fed and honored …
		because it induced savages to bring up their offspring instead of letting
		it perish. But although it was useful to hold that opinion, the opinion
		was false”. “Mankind has always wanted, perhaps always required,
		and certainly made itself, a stock of delusions and sophisms”.<a href="#footnote_10" id="fnm10" title="Lee: Vital Lies..." class="fnmarker">10</a></p>

		<p>Perhaps we would all agree that the belief that ‘God is on our side’
		has been useful to the tribe holding it. If has increased zeal and fighting
		efficiency tremendously. But since God can’t be on both sides, the
		belief of one party to the conflict is untrue, no matter how useful. To
		believe that (beneficial) tribal customs are enforced by the tribal gods
		is useful, but if the tribal gods are non-existent the belief is false. The
		beautiful imaginings of poets are sometimes useful in minimizing and
		disguising the hard and ugly reality, but when they will not test out
		they cannot be said because of their beauty or desirability to be true.</p>

		<p>We must conclude then, that some delusions are useful. And we
		may go on and question James’ identification of truth and utility from
		another point of view. Instead of agreeing that true ideas and useful
		ideas are the same, we have shown that some useful ideas are false:
		but the converse is also demonstrable, that some true ideas are useless.</p>

		<p>There are formulas in pure science which are of no use to anyone
		outside the science because their practical bearings, if such there be,
		have not yet been discovered, and are of no use to the scientist himself
		because, themselves the products of deduction, they as yet suggest nothing
		that can be developed farther from them. While these formulas
		may later be found useful in either of these senses—for ‘practical demands’
		outside the science, or as a means to something else within the
		science—they are now already true quite apart from utility, because
		they will test out by fulfilling expectations.</p>

		<p>Knowledge that is not useful is most striking in relation to ‘vice’.
		<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>One may have a true idea as to how to lie and cheat, may know what
		cheating is and how it is done, and yet involve both himself and others
		in most <em>un</em>satisfactory consequences. The person who is attempting to
		stop the use of liquor, and who to this end has located in a ‘dry’ district,
		may receive correct information as to the location of a ‘blind-tiger’—information
		which while true may bring about his downfall. Knowledge
		about any form of vice, true knowledge that can be tested out, may
		upon occasion be harmful to any extent we like.</p>

		<p>We may conclude this section by citing a paragraph which will
		show the fallacious reasoning by which James came to identify the
		truth and the utility of ideas. At one point in replying to a criticism
		he says: “I can conceive no other objective <em>content</em> to the notion of an
		ideally perfect truth than that of penetration into [a completely satisfactory]
		terminus, nor can I conceive that the notion would ever have
		grown up, or that true ideas would ever have been sorted out from false
		or idle ones, save for the greater sum of satisfactions, intellectual or
		practical, which the truer ones brought with them. Can we imagine a
		man absolutely satisfied with an idea and with all his relations to his
		other ideas and to his sensible experiences, who should yet <em>not</em> take its
		content as a true account of reality? The <em>matter</em> of the true is thus
		absolutely identical with the matter of the satisfactory. You may put
		either word first in your way of talking; but leave out that whole notion
		of satisfactory working or leading (which is the essence of my pragmatic
		account) and call truth a static, logical relation, independent even
		of possible leadings or satisfactions, and it seems to me that you cut all
		ground from under you”. (Meaning of Truth, p. 160).<a href="#footnote_11" id="fnm11" title="It is interesting..." class="fnmarker">11</a></p>

		<p>Now it is to be observed that this paragraph contains at least three
		logical fallacies. In the first sentence there is a false assumption, namely
		that ‘all that survives is valuable’. ‘Then’, we are given to understand,
		‘since true ideas survive, they must be valuable’. No biologist would
		agree to this major premise. ‘Correlation’ preserves many things that
		are not valuable, as also do other factors.</p>

		<p>In the second sentence there is an implied false conversion. The
		second sentence says, in substance, that all true ideas are satisfactory
		(valuable). This is supposed to prove the assertion of the first sentence,
		namely, that all satisfactory (valuable) ideas are true.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>In the last sentence there is a false disjunction. Truth, it is stated,
		must either be satisfactory (valuable) working, or a static logical relation.
		We have tried to show that it may simply mean reliable working
		or working that leads as it promised. This may be neither predominantly
		valuable working nor a static logical relation.</p>

		<p><span id="subsection2-3-3" class="subsection_title">The Relation of Satisfaction to Agreement and Consistency.</span>—James
		continually reasserts that he has ‘remained an epistemological realist’,
		that he has ‘always postulated an independent reality’, that ideas to be
		true must ‘agree with reality’, etc.<a href="#footnote_12" id="fnm12" title="For example,..." class="fnmarker">12</a></p>

		<p>Reality he defines most clearly as follows:</p>

		<p>“‘Reality’ is in general what truths have to take account of….</p>

		<p>“The first part of reality from this point of view is the flux of our
		sensations. Sensations are forced upon us…. Over their nature, order
		and quantity we have as good as no control….</p>

		<p>“The second part of reality, as something that our beliefs must
		also take account of, is the <em>relations</em> that obtain between their copies in
		our minds. This part falls into two sub-parts: (1) the relations that are
		mutable and accidental, as those of date and place; and (2) those that
		are fixed and essential because they are grounded on the inner nature
		of their terms. Both sorts of relation are matters of immediate perception.
		Both are ‘facts’….</p>

		<p>“The third part of reality, additional to these perceptions (tho
		largely based upon them), is the <em>previous truths</em> of which every new
		inquiry takes account”. (Pragmatism, p. 244).</p>

		<p>An idea’s agreement with reality, or better with all those parts of
		reality, means a satisfactory relation of the idea to them. Relation to
		the sensational part of reality is found satisfactory when the idea leads
		to it without jar or discord. “… What do the words verification and
		validation themselves pragmatically mean? They again signify certain
		practical consequences of the verified and validated idea. It is hard
		to find any one phrase that characterizes these consequences better than
		the ordinary agreement-formula—just such consequences being what we
		have in mind when we say that our ideas ‘agree’ with reality. They
		lead us, namely, through the acts and other ideas which they instigate,
		into and up to, or towards, other parts of experience with which we feel
		all the while … that the original ideas remain in agreement. The connections
		and transitions come to us from point to point as being progressive,
		harmonious, satisfactory. This function of agreeable leading
		is what we mean by an idea’s verification”. (Pragmatism, pp. 201-2).</p>

		<p>An idea’s relation to the other parts of reality is conceived more
		broadly. Thus pragmatism’s “only test of probable truth is what works
		<a class="pagenum" id="page33" title="33"> </a>best in the way of leading us, what fits every part of life best and combines
		with the collectivity of life’s demands, nothing being omitted. If
		theological ideas should do this, if the notion of God, in particular, should
		prove to do it, how could pragmatism possibly deny God’s existence?
		She could see no meaning in treating as ‘not true’ a notion that was
		pragmatically so successful. What other kind of truth could there be,
		for her, than all this <em>agreement with concrete reality</em>”? (Pragmatism,
		p. 80, italics mine). Agreement with reality here means ability to
		satisfy the sum of life’s demands.</p>

		<p>James considers that this leaves little room for license in the choice
		of our beliefs. “Between the coercions of the sensible order and those
		of the ideal order, our mind is thus wedged tightly”. “Our (any)
		theory must mediate between all previous truths and certain new experiences.
		It must derange common sense and previous belief as little as
		possible, and it must lead to some sensible terminus or other that can be
		verified exactly. To ‘work’ means both these things; and the squeeze
		is so tight that there is little loose play for any hypothesis. Our theories
		are thus wedged and controlled as nothing else is”. “Pent in, as the
		pragmatist more than anyone else sees himself to be, between the whole
		body of funded truths squeezed from the past and the coercions of the
		world of sense about him, who so well as he feels the immense pressure
		of objective control under which our minds perform their operations”.
		(Pragmatism, pp. 211, 217, 233).</p>

		<p>Now on the contrary it immediately occurs to a reader that if
		reality be simply “what truths have to take account of”, and if taking-account-of
		merely means agreeing in such a way as to satisfy “the collectivity
		of life’s demands”, then the proportion in which these parts of
		reality will count will vary enormously. One person may find the
		‘previous-truths’ part of reality to make such a strong ‘demand’ that
		he will disregard ‘principles’ or reasoning almost entirely.</p>

		<p>Another may disregard the ‘sensational’ part of reality, and give no
		consideration whatever to ‘scientific’ results. These things, in fact, are
		exactly the things that do take place. The opinionated person, the
		crank, the fanatic, as well as the merely prejudiced, all refuse to open
		their minds and give any particular consideration to such kinds of
		evidence. There is therefore a great deal of room for license, and a
		great deal of license practiced, when the agreement of our ideas with
		reality means nothing more than their satisfactoriness to our lives’ demands.</p>

		<p>How James fell into this error is shown, I believe, by his overestimation
		of the common man’s regard for truth, and especially for
		consistency. Thus he remarks:  “As we humans are constituted in
		point of fact, we find that to believe in other men’s minds, in independent
		<a class="pagenum" id="page34" title="34"> </a>physical realities, in past events, in eternal logical relations, is
		satisfactory…. Above all we find <em>consistency</em> satisfactory, consistency
		between the present idea and the entire rest of our mental equipment….”
		“After man’s interest in breathing freely, the greatest of all his interests
		(because it never fluctuates or remits, as most of his physical
		interests do), is his interest in <em>consistency</em>, in feeling that what he now
		thinks goes with what he thinks on other occasions”. (Meaning of
		Truth, pp. 192, 211).</p>

		<p>The general method of James on this point, then, is to define truth
		in terms of satisfaction and then to try to show that these satisfactions
		cannot be secured illegitimately. That is, that we <em>must</em> defer to experimental
		findings, to consistency, and to other <em>checks</em> on opinion. Consistency
		must be satisfactory because people are so constituted as to
		find it so. Agreement with reality, where reality means epistemological
		reality, is satisfactory for the same reason. And agreement with reality,
		where reality includes in addition principles and previous truths, must
		be satisfactory because agreement in this case merely means such taking-account-of
		as will satisfy the greater proportion of the demands of
		life. In other words, by defining agreement in this case in terms of
		satisfactions, he makes it certain that agreement and satisfaction will
		coincide by the device of arguing in a circle. It turns out that, from
		over-anxiety to assure the coincidence of agreement and satisfaction, he
		entirely loses the possibility of using reality and agreement with reality
		in the usual sense of checks on satisfactions.</p>

		<h2 class="chapter_title"><span class="chapter_number">CHAPTER <abbr title="three">III.</abbr></span><br />
		The Pragmatic Doctrine as Set Forth by Dewey.</h2>

		<p>The position of Dewey is best represented in his paper called “<span id="section3-1">The
		Experimental Theory of Knowledge</span>”.<a href="#footnote_13" id="fnm13" title="Mind, N. S. 15,..." class="fnmarker">13</a> In the method of presentation,
		this article is much like James’ account “The Function of Cognition”.
		Both assume some simple type of consciousness and study it by gradually
		introducing more and more complexity. In aim, also, the two are
		similar, for the purpose of each is simply to describe. Dewey attempts
		here to tell of a knowing just as one describes any other object, concern,
		or event. “What we want”, he announces “is just something which
		takes itself for knowledge, rightly or wrongly”.</p>

		<p>Let us suppose, then, that we have simply a floating odor. If this
		odor starts changes that end in picking and enjoying a rose, what sort
		of changes must these be to involve some where within their course that
		which we call knowledge?</p>

		<p>Now it can be shown, first, that there is a difference between knowing
		and mere presence in consciousness. If the smell is simply displaced
		by a felt movement, and this in turn is displaced by the enjoyment
		of the rose, in such a way that there is no experience of connection
		between the three stages of the process,—that is, without the appearance
		of memory or anticipation,—then “such an experience neither
		is, in whole or in part, a knowledge”. “Acquaintance is presence honored
		by an escort; presence is introduced as familiar, or an association springs
		up to greet it. Acquaintance always implies a little friendliness; a trace
		of re-knowing, of anticipatory welcome or dread of the trait to follow….
		To be a smell (or anything else) is one thing, to be <em>known</em> as a
		smell, another; to be a ‘feeling’ is one thing, to be <em>known</em> as a ‘feeling’
		is another. The first is thinghood; existence indubitable, direct; in this
		way all things <em>are</em> that are in ‘consciousness’ at all. The second is
		<em>reflected</em> being, things indicating and calling for other things—something
		offering the possibility of truth and hence of falsity. The first is
		genuine immediacy; the second (in the instance discussed) a pseudo-immediacy,
		which in the same breath that it proclaims its immediacy
		smuggles in another term (and one which is unexperienced both in itself
		and in its relation) the subject of ‘consciousness’, to which the immediate
		is related…. To be acquainted with a thing is to be assured (from
		the standpoint of the experience itself) that it is of such and such a
		character; that it will behave, if given an opportunity, in such and such
		a way; that the obviously and flagrantly present trait is associated with
		fellow traits that will show themselves if the leading of the present
		<a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36"> </a>trait is followed out. To be acquainted is to anticipate to some extent,
		on the basis of previous experience”. (pp. 81, 82).</p>

		<p>Besides mere existence, there is another type of experience which
		is often confused with knowledge,—a type which Dewey calls the
		‘cognitive’ as distinct from genuine knowledge or the ‘cognitional’. In
		this experience “we retrospectively attribute intellectual force and function
		to the smell”. This involves memory but not anticipation. As we
		look back from the enjoyment of the rose, we can say that in a sense
		the odor meant the rose, even though it led us here blindly. That is, if
		the odor suggests the finding of its cause, without specifying what the
		cause is, and if we then search about and find the rose, we can say that
		the odor meant the rose in the sense that it actually led to the discovery
		of it. “Yet the <ins title="small was">smell is</ins> not cognitional because it did not knowingly
		intend to mean this, but is found, after the event, to have meant
		it”. (p. 84).</p>

		<p>Now, “before the category of confirmation or refutation can be
		introduced, there must be something which <em>means</em> to mean something”.
		Let us therefore introduce a further complexity into the illustration.
		Let us suppose that the <ins title="small">smell</ins> occurs at a later date, and is then “aware
		of something else which it means, which it intends to effect by an operation
		incited by it and without which its own presence is abortive, and,
		so to say, unjustified, senseless”. Here we have something “which is
		contemporaneously aware of meaning something beyond itself, instead
		of having this meaning ascribed to it by another at a later period. <em>The
		odor knows the rose</em>, <em>the rose is known by the odor</em>, and the import of
		each term is constituted by the relationship in which it stands to the
		other”. (p. 88). This is the genuine ‘cognitional’ experience.</p>

		<p>When the odor recurs ‘cognitionally’, both the odor and the rose
		are present in the same experience, though both are not present in the
		same way. “Things can be presented as absent, just as they can be
		presented as hard or soft”. The enjoyment of the rose is present as
		<em>going</em> to be there in the same way that the odor is. “The situation is
		inherently an uneasy one—one in which everything hangs upon the performance
		of the operation indicated; upon the adequacy of movement
		as a connecting link, or real adjustment of the thing meaning and the
		thing meant. Generalizing from this instance, we get the following
		definition: An experience is a knowledge, if in its quale there is an
		experienced distinction and connection of two elements of the following
		sort: one means or intends the presence of the other in the same fashion
		in which it itself is already present, while the other is that which, while
		not present in the same fashion, must become present if the meaning
		or intention of its companion or yoke-fellow is to be fulfilled through
		the operation it sets up”. (p. 90).</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37"> </a>Now in the transformation from this tensional situation into a
		harmonious situation, there is an experience either of fulfilment or disappointment.
		If there is a disappointment of expectation, this may
		throw one back in reflection upon the original situation. The smell, we
		may say, seemed to mean a rose, yet it did not in fact lead to a rose.
		There is something else which enters in. We then begin an investigation.
		“Smells may become the object of knowledge. They may take,
		<em>pro tempore</em>, the place which the rose formerly occupied. One may,
		that is, observe the cases in which the odors mean other things than
		just roses, may voluntarily produce new cases for the sake of further
		inspection; and thus account for the <ins title="cses">cases</ins> where meanings had been
		falsified in the issue; discriminate more carefully the peculiarities of
		those meanings which the event verified, and thus safeguard and bulwark
		to some extent the employing of similar meanings in the future”.
		(p. 93). When we reflect upon these fulfilments or refusals, we find in
		them a quality “quite lacking to them in their immediate <ins title="occurence">occurrence</ins> as
		just fulfilments and disappointments”,—the quality of affording assurance
		and correction. “Truth and falsity are not properties of any experience
		or thing, in and of itself or in its first intention; but of things
		where the problem of assurance consciously enters in. Truth and
		falsity present themselves as significant facts only in situations in which
		specific meanings and their already experienced fulfilments and non-fulfilments
		are intentionally compared and contrasted with reference to the
		question of the worth, as to the reliability of meaning, of the given
		meaning or class of meanings. Like knowledge itself, truth is an experienced
		relation of things, and it has no meaning outside of such
		relation”. (p. 95).</p>

		<p>Though this paper is by title a discussion of a theory of knowledge,
		we may find in this last paragraph a very clear relating of the whole to
		a theory of truth. If we attempt to differentiate in this article between
		knowledge and truth, we find that while Dewey uses ‘knowledge’ to refer
		either to the prospective or to the retrospective end of the experimental
		experience, he evidently intends to limit truth to the retrospective or
		confirmatory end of the experience. When he says, “Truth and falsity
		are not properties of any experience or thing in and of itself or in its
		first intention, but of things where the problem of assurance consciously
		enters in. Truth and falsity present themselves as significant facts only
		in situations in which specific meanings and their already experienced
		fulfilments are intentionally compared and contrasted with reference to
		the question of the worth, as to reliability of meaning, of the given
		meaning or class of meanings”, it seems that truth is to be confined to
		<a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38"> </a>retrospective experience. The truth of an idea means that it allows one
		at its fulfilment to look back at its former meaning and think of it as
		now confirmed. The difference between knowledge and truth is then a
		difference in the time at which the developing <ins title="experince">experience</ins> is examined.
		If one takes the experience at the appearance of the knowing odor, he
		gets acquaintance; if one takes it <ins title="t">at</ins> the stage at which it has developed
		into a confirmation, he gets truth. Knowledge may be either stage of
		the experience of verification, but truth is confined to the later, confirmatory,
		stage.</p>

		<p>Truth, then, is simply a matter of  confirmation of  prediction or of
		fulfilment of expectation. An idea is made true by leading as it
		promised. And an idea is made false when it leads to refutation of  expectation.
		There seems to be no necessity here for an absolute reality
		for the ideas to conform to, or ‘correspond’ to, for truth is a <ins title="certian">certain</ins>
		kind of relation between the ideas themselves—the relation, namely, of
		leading to fulfilment of  expectations.</p>

		<h3 id="section3-2" class="section_title">Contrast Between James and Dewey.</h3>

		<p>If, now, we wish to bring out the difference between the account
		of truth which we have just examined and the account that is given by
		James, we will find the distinction quite evident. Truth, for Dewey, is
		that relation which arises when, at an experience of fulfilment, one looks
		back to the former experience and thinks of its leading as now confirmed.
		An idea is true, therefore, when we can refer back to it in this
		way and say, “That pointing led me to this experience, as it said it
		would”. The pointing, by bringing a fulfilment, is <em>made</em> true—at this
		point of  confirmation it <em>becomes</em> true.</p>

		<p>Since a true idea is defined, then, as one which leads as it promised,
		it is obvious that truth will not be concerned in any way with incidental
		or accidental <em>values</em> which might be led to by the idea. It has no relation
		to whether the goal is <em>worth while</em> being led to or not. James speaks
		of truth as a leading that is worth while. For Dewey the goal may be
		valuable, useless, or even pernicious,—these are entirely irrelevant to
		truth, which is determined solely by the fact that the idea leads <em>as it
		promised</em>.</p>

		<p>The existence of  this distinction was pointed out, after the appearance
		of James’ “Pragmatism”, by Dewey himself.<a href="#footnote_14" id="fnm14" title="“What Does Pragmatism Mean..." class="fnmarker">14</a> After a careful
		discussion of some other points of  difference, he says of  this matter of
		the place of the value of an idea in reference to its truth: “We have
		<a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39"> </a>the theory that ideas as ideas are always working hypotheses concerning
		attaining particular empirical results, and are tentative programs (or
		sketches of method) for attaining them. If we stick consistently to this
		notion of ideas, only consequences which are actually produced by the
		working of the idea in cooperation with, or application to, prior realities
		are good consequences in the specific sense of good which is relevant to
		establishing the truth of an idea. This is, at times, unequivocally
		recognized by Mr. James…. But at other times any good that flows
		from acceptance of a belief is treated as if it were an evidence, <em>in so far</em>,
		of the truth of the idea. This holds particularly when theological notions
		are under consideration. Light would be thrown upon how Mr. James
		conceives this matter by statements from him on such points as these:
		If ideas terminate in good consequences, but yet the goodness of the
		consequence was no part of the intention of the idea, does the goodness
		have any verifying force? If the goodness of consequences arises from
		the context of the idea rather than from the idea itself, does it have
		any verifying force? If an idea leads to consequences which are good
		in the <em>one</em> respect only of fulfilling the intent of the idea, (as when one
		drinks a liquid to test the idea that it is a poison), does the badness of
		the consequences in every other respect detract from the verifying force
		of these consequences?</p>

		<p>“Since Mr. James has referred to me as saying ‘truth is what gives
		satisfaction’ (p. 234), I may remark … that I never identified <em>any</em>
		satisfaction with the truth of an idea, save <em>that</em> satisfaction which arises
		when the idea as working hypothesis or tentative method is applied to
		prior existences in such a way as to fulfil what it intends….</p>

		<p>“When he says … of the idea of an absolute, ‘so far as it affords
		such comfort it surely is not sterile, it has that amount of value; it performs
		a concrete function. As a good pragmatist I ought to call the
		absolute true <em>in so far forth</em> then; and I unhesitatingly now do so’, the
		doctrine seems to be unambiguous: that <em>any</em> good, consequent upon
		acceptance of belief, is, in so far forth, a warrant for truth. Of course
		Mr. James holds that this ‘in so far’ goes a very small way…. But even
		the slightest concession, is, I think, non-pragmatic unless the satisfaction
		is relevant to the idea as intent. Now the satisfaction in question
		comes not from the <em>idea as idea</em>, but from its acceptance <em>as true</em>. Can a
		satisfaction dependent upon an assumption that an idea is already true
		be relevant to testing the truth of an idea? And can an idea, like that
		of the absolute, which, if true, ‘absolutely’ precludes any appeal to
		consequences as test of truth, be confirmed by use of the pragmatic test
		without sheer self-contradiction”?<a href="#footnote_15" id="fnm15" title="The last four sentences..." class="fnmarker">15</a> “An explicit statement as to whether
		<a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40"> </a>the carrying function, the linking of things, is satisfactory and prosperous
		and hence true in so far as it executes the intent of the idea; or
		whether the satisfaction and prosperity reside in the material consequences
		on their own account and in that aspect make the idea true,
		would, I am sure, locate the point at issue and economize and fructify
		future discussion. At present pragmatism is accepted by those whose
		own notions are thoroughly rationalistic in make-up as a means of refurbishing,
		galvanizing, and justifying those very notions. It is rejected
		by non-rationalists (empiricists and naturalistic idealists) because it
		seems to them identified with the notion that pragmatism holds that the
		desirability of certain beliefs overrides the question of the meaning of
		the idea involved in them and the existence of objects denoted by them.
		Others (like myself) who believe thoroughly in pragmatism as a method
		of orientation as defined by Mr. James, and who would apply the method
		to the determination of the meaning of objects, the intent and worth of
		ideas as ideas, and to the human and moral value of beliefs, when these
		problems are carefully distinguished from one another, do not know
		whether they are pragmatists or not, because they are not sure whether
		the ‘practical’, in the sense of the desirable facts which define the worth
		of a belief, is confused with the practical as an attitude imposed by
		objects, and with the practical as a power and function of idea to effect
		changes in prior existences. Hence the importance of knowing what
		pragmatism means by practical….</p>

		<p>“I would do Mr. James an injustice, however, to stop here. His
		real doctrine, I think, is that a belief is true when it satisfies <em>both</em> the
		personal needs <em>and</em> the requirements of objective things. Speaking of
		pragmatism, he says, ‘Her only test of probable truth is what works best
		in the way of <em>leading us</em>, what fits every part of life best <em>and combines
		with the collectivity of <ins title="experiences">experience’s</ins> demands</em>, nothing being omitted’.
		And again, ‘That new idea is truest which performs most felicitously its
		function of satisfying <em>our double urgency</em>’. (p. 64). It does not appear
		certain from the context that this ‘double urgency’ is that of the personal
		and the objective demands, but it is probable…. On this basis, the ‘in
		so far forth’ of the truth of the absolute because of the comfort it supplies,
		means that <em>one</em> of the two conditions which need to be satisfied
		has been met, so that if the absolute met the other one also it would be
		quite true. I have no doubt that <ins title="his">this</ins> is Mr. James’ meaning, and it
		sufficiently safeguards him from charges that pragmatism means that
		anything that is agreeable is true. At the same time, I do not think, in
		logical strictness, that satisfying one of two tests, when satisfaction of
		both is required, can be said to constitute a belief true even ‘in so far
		forth<ins title="missing">’</ins>”.</p>

		Summary and Conclusion.</h2>
		<p>Writing as a scientist and publishing his work in a scientific journal,
		Peirce proposed in 1878 a new method for making our ideas clear. He
		was attempting a description of the logic of the sciences. He believed
		himself to be showing how the greatest of our modern thinkers do make
		clear to themselves their ideas of the objects with which they work.
		The meaning of anything, said Peirce, consists in the actual or possible
		effects which it might produce. Our idea of the thing is clear when we
		have in mind these sensible effects. This theory of clearness he called
		pragmatism.</p>

		<p>No one, it seems, paid any especial attention to this theory at the
		time. But twenty years later James brought the subject to the forefront
		of discussion by explaining it anew in his exceptionally lucid way and
		by making a particular application of it to religion. But for James the
		method for clearness very soon grew into a new theory of truth, and
		in this way, in spite of the fact that the method had been proposed by a
		scientist as a description of the procedure of science, he seems to have
		lost for it the support of science. The <ins title="reasons">reason</ins> for this outcome was his
		introduction of value as a criterion for truth. This, James recognizes,
		was counter to all the scientific ideals of many of the workers in science,
		for the essence of their procedure, as they saw it, was to put all desire
		as to outcomes behind them and to try to find out how things actually
		prove or test out to be, quite apart from how we would like them to be.
		To introduce the general value of an outcome, then, as a criterion for
		truth, seems to destroy what the scientist had been thinking of as ‘pure
		research’, and to involve control by an outside influence that would determine
		which things are or are not valuable and worth investigating.
		It was sufficiently well known to the scientist that most of the greatest
		scientific discoveries were made by men who had no appreciation or
		interest in the general utility of the outcome, and whose results were
		applied only much later and, as it were, by accident. To say, then, that
		the truth of an idea was influenced by its general value was to run afoul
		of all the sorely sensitive ideals which the scientist had acquired in his
		recent contest with the domination of the church. It is hardly to be
		wondered at, therefore, that the interpretation of pragmatism given by
		James was not popular with persons of a scientific temperament.</p>

		<p>Further, if the value or desirability of an idea has an influence upon
		its truth, then truth will vary from person to person, for desirability
		varies with the taste of the person concerned. Peirce had warned against
		individual standards of truth in his discussion of the Methods of Fixing
		Belief. The scientific conception, as it had <ins title="differenciated">differentiated</ins> itself from
		<a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42"> </a>other conceptions of truth, had attempted to secure a kind of truth not
		determined by what we would like or by what can be made to seem
		desirable by oratory or by what can be made to win out over other
		opinions by skill in debate, but by some criterion quite apart from desire
		and opinion. Peirce had attempted such a criterion in his postulate of
		an unchanging eternal reality. Instead, that is, of consulting with each
		other, of debating with each other to find the truth, we ought to consult
		this reality. In other words, to undertake scientific experiment. Such
		had been Peirce’s description of the scientific and modern method of
		attaining truth as contrasted, as he says, with that of the medievalists.</p>

		<p>Now the difficulty in Peirce’s method, as we have seen, was that
		this postulate of an external reality unaffected by our opinions would
		not endure the test for clearness. Every object, says Peirce, reduces
		to the sum of its effects. The only effect of real things, he says again,
		is to produce belief. From these two propositions it would seem to
		follow that reality is a sum of beliefs. But this, of course, eliminates
		any unchanging reality independent of our opinions about it.</p>

		<p>We saw further that Peirce defined both belief and meaning as
		habit and made no distinction between them. Now as belief and meaning
		are obviously not the same, we are in need of new definitions for
		these terms.</p>

		<p>At this point we turned to the interpretation of Dewey. For Dewey
		the distinction would seem to be that while meaning may well be defined
		as habit, belief is to be defined as expectation. If we believe in anything,
		this means that we expect certain results from it. To believe is
		to suppose that if we were to come into relation with the thing we
		would find certain effects to come about.</p>

		<p>From this conception the Deweyan theory of truth would seem to
		follow immediately. If belief means a sum of expectations, the truth
		of a belief would mean the verification of these expectations. A true
		belief simply means one that fulfils expectations.</p>

		<p>The Deweyan development of the pragmatic method is obviously
		very much more in harmony with the procedure of science than that of
		James. James seems to have ‘left the track’ in his interpretation of the
		pragmatic method when he related truth to the predominantly valuable.
		Truth we have found to have no necessary or invariable connection
		with general value, for many ideas would be acknowledged to be perfectly
		true while at the same time being either useless or harmful. For
		Dewey this matter of value has no place in relation to the test of the
		truth of an idea, for its truth means nothing more than its ability to
		lead as it promises.</p>

		<p>We seem, then, it may be said in conclusion, to be confronted with
		something like the following alternatives:</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page43" title="43"> </a>If we believe that Dewey could not have made a correct deduction
		from the pragmatic method when he developed it into a theory of truth
		making truth dependent upon fulfilled expectations alone, then very
		obviously the next step in this investigation is to find the point at which
		his inference went wrong. This means a re-examination of each step in
		his reasoning.</p>

		<p>If we believe that Dewey does make a correct deduction from the
		pragmatic method in this development toward truth, then we are confronted
		with the alternative of either accepting the Deweyan theory of
		truth or of rejecting the Peircian theory of clearness. That is, if we
		begin with Peirce on method, we must then go clear through to Dewey
		on truth. And if we reject Dewey, while believing that Peirce gave a
		correct description of the method of science, then it seems that we
		must conclude that the method of science and the method of philosophy
		are not the same.</p>

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
